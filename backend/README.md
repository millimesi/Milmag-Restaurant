Backend of Milmag Restaurant Application

(DATABASE and Express)
What to do to get the database running:
1. Download postgresql on your terminal (Get this from https://www.postgresql.org/)
2. On terminal, follow this video to create a 'user' and 'database' on postgresql terminal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxu1RrR0vbw 
3. Install node v20.17.0   (Latest LTS: Iron)
4. run 'npm install' to install the dependencies in package.json on vscode.
5. run 'npm start', you should see a message 'Database & tables synced'
6. Optional: You can also download 'PGAdmin4' and connect the database to it
7. Don't forget to create .gitignore file to add 'node_modules/' and '.env'
8. The .env_examples file contains the environment variable details that is needed in the application.

For Express:
1. Express has been installed in the dependency when you ran 'npm install'
2. When you run 'npm start', you should see 'Database & tables synced' and after that, you should see 'Server is running on PORT ...'
